# Payment Devices #

Our revolutionary software developer kit is based on Android.  Developers can now use the power of Android Studio, JetBrains Rider, or even Visual Studio to develop modern applications for the Android platform and test them on-device before publication into our application store.  No more need for painful memory management of C/C++.  You've trained your developers on modern tools, and now, you can let them finally use them for your next-generation applications requiring acceptance of payments.
