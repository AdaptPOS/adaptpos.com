Midnight Oil Systems, LLC (AdaptPOS) was established in 2012 to create products to service the Point-of-Sale industry. We quickly realized that part of delivering great products to merchants, we had to pair ideas from the merchant services industry within the Point-of-Sale industry.

Today we seek to bridge an understanding between these two industries so that both have a standard by which to start from. We aim to bring them closer to newer technologies and a better class of products that ‘talk’ to each other with more ease.

AdaptPOS products are built as a software-as-a-service model tailored to service brick-and-mortar shops to large enterprise businesses.

We aim to partner with many POS software to enable them a wide, easy adoption of EMV and Gift, oriented products.
