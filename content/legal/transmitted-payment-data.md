## Security of Transmitted Payment Data ##

__What information do we collect and how do we use it?__

When you place an order through this website, we need to know your name, e-mail, and credit card details if paying by credit card. This allows us to process and fulfill your order successfully. It also helps us in maintaining your account.

__How does Midnight Oil System dba AdaptPOS protect customer information?__

When you place orders, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the sensitive customer data we collect is protected by several layers of encryption and several layers of security to prevent unauthorized access.

__Credit Card Details__

All credit card payments are processed securely through USAePAY. Midnight Oil Systems dba AdaptPOS does not store any credit card information on our servers.

__What about Cookies?__

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. They allow you to place your online order and to log in, once you are subscribed. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

__Payment Gateway Info__

Our payment options presently available are limited but, most importantly, safe and secure. None of your payment details are stored – this ensures you will be happy with the security of your transaction.


__Transport Layer Security (TLS)__

All of USAePay’s communications and processing occur through Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet. To ensure the highest level of security, USAePay uses a 2048-bit RSA key and does not support cyphers known to be weak or vulnerable.

__Level 1 PCI Compliant__

As one of the first payment gateways to become Level-1 PCI compliant, USAePay is committed to ensuring that all processed, stored or transmitted credit card information maintain a completely secure environment. USAePay updates our PCI guidelines based on updates of regulations and requirements through our annual Level-1 audit. This audit includes scanning our system thoroughly and submitting a complete Report of Compliance (RoC) to the PCI Security Standards Council. To request our Acceptance of Compliance (AoC) report, banks and resellers can email us at resellers@USAePay.com
