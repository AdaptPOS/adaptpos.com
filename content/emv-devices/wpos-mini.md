For all of your solutions you develop for iPhone and Android phones, this device can replace the need for an mPOS device by offering the ability to deploy your application on the same device as the payment application; removing the need to use bluetooth technology to connect the mPOS device to your phone.  This provides greater reliability.

Oh, and if you need a great terminal for pairing with your point-of-sale, consider the wpos-mini with its smaller size and IP-Based Semi-Integration Protocol, you can still do sign-on-screen and everything else you would like, at a more cost effective price point.
